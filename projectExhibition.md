## HOW TO PARTICIPATE
**STEP 1. REGISTER.**
Before you start working on your project, decide whether you want to work as an individual or in a team. Then, register yourself or your team before the registration deadline along with your project idea and topic under which you are working. No unregistered individuals/teams will be allowed to participate. All the teams are allowed to have maximum one mentor which can be anyone. Out of campus participation is also allowed in team members as well as mentors. The maximum number of team members allowed for one project is 5 including the mentor.

**STEP 2. BUILD YOUR PROJECT.**
You're about to embark on an exciting journey over the next couple of months while you're building your project. After you pick a theme and finalize a project idea, you're ready to get started with building. Building can mean anything from physically putting together machine parts for a robot to writing code for a mobile app to prototyping a new prosthetic device. The possibilities are endless. After an initial build, you'll want to test it to make sure everything works the way you want it to. And after multiple retests and rebuilds, you'll finally end up with a product that you're not only proud of, but which can make a difference. 

While the building of project, every team must ensure that their progress report is submitted every fortnight (after every two weeks) which will include the details of the project work completed till then. Any team failing to do so will be responsible for the deduction of their marks in the competition.

**STEP 3.  SUBMIT.**
Once you're satisfied with your project, you're ready to submit. Make sure you have all the necessary documents and materials you need and don't wait until the last minute to submit. The submission portal will open in July mid of 2017. After you've submitted, congratulate yourself!

## WHAT TO SUBMIT
**PICK A TOPIC FOR YOUR PROJECT**

* **ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING**
	* **MICROCONTROLLER DESIGN:** create a product using microcontroller which solves any real life problem.  
	* **IOT:** Display the concept of iot using a working prototype which solves a real life problem and lessens the human effort. Example smart cars.  
	* **COMMUNICATION:** Design a communication network which uses minimum power to transmit or receive data in areas where there are limited sources of energy.
	* **DISASTER MANAGEMENT:** your product must be able to deal with the problems caused by any one of the disasters and lessen its effect.
	* **POLLUTION REDUCTION IN TRANSPORTATION:** Design a product to deal with the pollution caused by the vehicles.
	
* **COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING**
	* **WEBSITE DESIGN:** 
		1. **CONTEXT** On July 20, 1969, the United States space program made history when an American walked on the moon. On July 21, 2011, the United States space shuttle program ended its thirty-year mission when the shuttle Atlantis touched down in Florida. Now, private companies are pushing the race to space. Does humankind still dream of one day standing on the “Red Planet” or is that vision lost? Where do we go from here? Who will lead the charge to explore the worlds in our solar system? Could it be you?  
		2. **CHALLENGE STATEMENT** Design a series of web pages that highlights the privatization of space exploration and the ongoing search for ways to explore our solar system – including the possibility to eventually colonize Mars. As part of the solution, teams should: 

			* Highlight the privatization of space exploration and the ongoing search for ways to explore our solar system.  
			* Provide an interactive timeline of the recent history of the privatization of the space program and the U.S. space program dating back to 1990.   
			* Include information about the evolution of space vehicles, both manned and unmanned, used in the space program - with a special focus on current and proposed designs.  
 			* Highlight five career fields that are developing or that currently exist in the fields of aerospace or aeronautics related to space program/exploration.   
			* Discuss both the positive and negative impacts on our society if humankind fails to explore and eventually inhabit other parts of our solar system.  
 			* Include at least two multimedia interviews with individuals who work in fields related to the space program – such as, aeronautical engineering or aerospace engineering. Interviews must be conducted by team participants.  
 			* Provide a resources page. Place a link on this page that allows the viewer to download a PDF copy of your Student Copyright Checklist [Regulation E] and/or Plan of Work log [Regulation F]. 

		3. **EVALUATION** Thought should be given to effective website design practices and cross-platform compatibility. All entries must be compatible using the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. Teams should strive to create a clean, easy-to-use website that features an excellent presentation of the required content. Teams should be very careful not to inadvertently plagiarize information from other sources, and instead give credit where credit is due; this includes the use of videos in the entry. Interviews must be conducted by the team only.
		
	* **APPMANIA:** design an app using your creativity
	
	* **VIDEOGAME DESIGN**
	
	* **3D ANIMATION:**
		* Destination: The Enclave Science fiction films have long been the staple of moviegoers. Each year, the special effects created by artists, such as you, take audiences to newer and more detailed alien worlds that are rich in history, culture, and adventure.  
 Your task is to design and model a city known as the Enclave, which exists on an alien planet far from the reaches of civilized space. Known throughout the galaxy as a gathering place for smugglers, pirates, and thieves, this city was originally designed as a “flea market” where goods with questionable histories could be exchanged and sold. However, the Enclave has grown into more of a semi-permanent establishment with shops, residences, and entertainment venues. Like the frontier towns of the old west United States, law enforcement is minimal – if there is even a law to be enforced. When justice comes to town, the Enclave’s dwellers scamper into hiding to avoid being detected and/or caught. Escape routes are the means of survival.  
 On a normal day, the Enclave is a bustling place with each and every inhabitant having something to trade, barter, or sell. Representatives from many alien cultures come here – some are mundane, while others are quite exotic – but each of them is reflected in the architecture of the individual buildings in the town.  
Your job is to envision and animate the Enclave’s main thoroughfare before people have risen to begin their daily tasks. The viewer of this animation needs to be able to imagine the various types of alien traders that inhabit this dynamic, cluttered environment. There should be all sorts of things moving, blinking, and splashing around. Music and sound may be part of the final animation; music and sound also should enhance the graphic images presented on the screen. 
You should emphasize the props and set pieces to sufficiently describe the street space, and then look to bring the main street alive with animating and dynamic elements.  
Use your still images and animation to highlight the history and culture of this bustling pirate refuge, telling the viewer a story (e.g., how the town evolved, or about the events of the day to come). Creativity will be one of the criteria judged!
 Lighting, composition, layout, and atmosphere may prove more important than the number of polygons or the complexity of textures.
 
	* **VIRTUAL REALITY**
	* **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**
	* **SAFETY OF COMPUTERS:** design solutions to keep your system as safe as possible. For ex- problems such as the “ransomware”.

* **BIOTECHNOLOGY:**
	* Area of focus : vaccines
	* Create a product using biometric technology
	* Design a solution to the problem of scarcity of safe drinking water.


## INTRODUCTION  (1 - 2  PAGES)
Provide a brief introduction to your technology and how you believe it addresses your chosen theme. You might also consider addressing why you believe your chosen topic is important to society and how your technology improves upon the current state of your topic. Make sure you clearly explain your topic here. For example, if you picked "IOT" and you want to focus on prosthetics, make sure you clearly explain what prosthetics are, problems with current prosthetics, and which of these problems you designed your technology to solve.

## TECHNOLOGY SUMMARY  (2 - 4  PAGES)
This is where you want to provide as much technical detail as possible to explain how your proposed solution actually works and provides an improvement to your chosen topic. If you prototyped something, provide labelled diagrams and explain the underlying scientific processes to your technology. If you programmed something, explain the algorithms you used and, if necessary, show samples of your code. After you clearly explain how all parts of your technology function, wrap up your summary by reiterating the major purpose of your project and how you addressed your topic. You may want to mention again how you addressed the issues with the current state of your topic.

## RESULTS  (2 - 3  PAGES)
For your results section, focus on not how your technology works, but how well it works. Here you want to show numerical values, data analysis, and quantitative comparisons you conducted. The point of this section is to show both quantitatively and qualitatively the success of your project in accomplishing what you set out to. For example, if you were programming a neural network to diagnose a disease, you would want to show what your accurate classification rate was, how that compares to existing methods of diagnosis, and what the confusion matrix was. This section would be a great place to put diagrams, graphs, and results of statistical tests. Think of it as both a data analysis and conclusion section.

## VIDEO  (2 - 5  MINUTES)
Your video should serve two purposes - to provide a visual depiction of your technology and to demonstrate your knowledge of it. Make sure you show your product working properly and then provide a brief description of how it works and what its purpose is. The video should basically be a condensed version of the rest of your report. It should be easy to understand and should hold the viewer's attention. Have fun with this! Think of it as your product's pitch. Please put your video on YouTube and make sure its settings are set to public.

## BLOG  POST  (300 - 650  WORDS)
The blog post will not be judged. Once the submission period ends, we will be posting one team's blog post each day to showcase your projects to the world. Blog posts will be posted on the website blog as well as on our social media pages. Your post should be succinct, but should also provide enough details so that readers can grasp the technical nature of your project. Make sure to show your technology's intended impact and to indicate your chosen theme. Embedded pictures are encouraged! We will also post a link to your team's YouTube video.

# HOW TO SUBMIT
The submission portal will open in July of 2017 and further instructions on how to use the portal will be posted then. In order to submit, you need to create your "Technical Report" and have your video ready. For your report, you need to include all of the sections mentioned above and clearly title the four different sections. Your cover page (the first page of your report) should include only your project title, your YouTube video link, your and/or your team members' names, and your branch names and year. Please do not provide any kind of contact information in your report. Provide page numbers for your report as well. When the portal opens, you will need to upload your technical report, which should be a single document, and your blog post, which will be a separate document. Please follow all of these instructions exactly as incomplete submissions will not be judged.
